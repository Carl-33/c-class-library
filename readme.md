# c-library


## Description 
  Walking through a C# and .NET tutorial series about class libraries. This program takes a string input and determines if the first letter of the string is a capitol letter or not. 
  
## Usage

Two options:
        
1. Download these files, and in the terminal type `dotnet run --project ShowCase/ShowCase.csproj` to start the program.  When prompted enter any string into the terminal.  The program will take the string and determine if the first letter is a capitol letter or not.  Either enter another string to continue running the program, or press the Enter key with an empty line to exit out.

2. Go to this [C# tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tutorials/library-with-visual-studio-code) to build the program for yourself.
